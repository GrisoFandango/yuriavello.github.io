              <b>Developing a Digital Identity</b><br />In this lesson, we went further on the understanding of the structure of an HTML page. We also introduced the use of CSS attributes, learn what a selector is, how to select an element, and how to start to decorate the element.<br />
  <b>Information System and Database</b><br />The focus of this lesson was to start to design tables for a database. It is essential to understand how each element in a table should not contain repeated elements. Normalize the data is essential to achieve a clean and organized database. Normalization of data is a process where we need to create a series of tables in a way that each table contains at least a unique element and not to have repeated elements. <br />
  <b>Introduction to Business Management</b><br/> focus of this week is about external factors that may influence a business. To have a better understanding of the external factors, a tool that is often used is the PESTLE/PESTEL analysis. The PESTEL analysis help to identify the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors that can affect a business.

              <b>Developing a Digital Identity</b><br />In this lesson, we learned the three way to use CSS in an HTML page. It is possible to write CSS in-line inside of an element, inside the head of the page or create a separate .css file to connect to the page. Furthermore, we learned new selectors and attributes to apply to the HTML elements in the page.<br />
  <b>Information System and Database</b><br />After learned the normalization of a database, we learn the different relationship between tables. There are three different possible relationship between the tables: one to one, one to many and many to many. One to one happens when one element of a table is correlated to only one element of another table. One to many happens when one element of a table is correlated with many other elements of another table. Many to many happen when many elements of a table are correlated with many other elements of another table. <br />
  <b>Introduction to Business Management</b><br />The lesson of this week was all about globalization. What are the management challenges of globalization? What are global businesses, and how do they work? What is culture, and how does it influence global management? How can we benefit from global management learning? We also outlined the different types of global business, pros and cons and the ethical challenges of global business.

              <b>Developing a Digital Identity</b><br />The focus of this week was on usability. For the usability of a website, we intend the user interface. To accomplish an excellent user interface, we need to think about how to design the website in a way that is easy to use for the end-user. Furthermore, it is essential to keep in mind the readability, using not to small font size and the right contrast of colours. We also need to take into account to choose the right palette of colour for users that may be colourblind.<br />
  <b>Information System and Database</b><br />In this week we start to use the Oracle software. We set up the name of the database; we created a few tables and started to exercises with some query. We saw the importance of good database design and how to use foreign keys to create a relationship between tables. 
  Introduction to Business Management<br />
  <b>Introduction to Business Management</b><br />After learning the PESTEL analysis, this week, we learn how to do the SWOT analysis.

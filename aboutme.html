        <h2><span>T</span>he <span>O</span>rigin</h2>
        <p>I was born in the beautiful city of Rome, where I lived until I was 18 years old, and then moving to Ancona with the Family. Then, in 2014, I decided to move abroad, specifically in the Uk. Now I am living in Luton, where I work and study.</p>

        <h2><span>M</span>y <span>S</span>tudies</h2>
        <p>
          In Italy, I have got a high school degree (the equivalent of A level in the UK) in electronics and telecommunication engineering, with a score of 90/100. In addition to that, since I was 12, I was taking a private course in programming, where I learn to code in Basic, C, and use a program
          called DBIII plus.
        </p>

        <h2><span>W</span>ork <span>E</span>xperience</h2>
        <p>
          Despite my course of study, I decided to join the family business. My parents always had a bar, and because they needed help, I invest my time in it. During this time, I did not stop to study. I attend several courses to improve my hospitality skill, like Bartender course, flair(freestyle
          with bottles), fruit carving and sommelier. During the years, I developed a strong communication skill, attention to details and customer service, along with much other ability.
        </p>

        <h2><span>T</span>he <span>F</span>uture</h2>
        <p>In 2018, I started a Bachelor degree at University West of London, in IT Management for Business starting from foundation year. I am planning to work in IT as soon as I can, and I am pushing my learning taking online courses that are not part of my university degree.</p>

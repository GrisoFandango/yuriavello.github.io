        <h2><span>V</span>ideogames</h2>
        <p>
          One of my first passion was technology, and specifically videogames. I still remember when I was like 4/5 years old, and my father got me my first console, the ATARI! Since then, more o less, I always played videogames. I jumped between console and pc games, passing through the Super
          Nintendo, then the first Playstation. For many years I played online with the PC, first with Lineage 2 and then League of Legends. In the last few years, I have to admit, my time with videogames diminished for various reason, but I am always ready to play them with my children
        </p>

        <h2><span>M</span>angas</h2>
        <p>
          When I was in high school, a friend of mine introduced me to mangas. My first one was Dragon Ball, and in the following years, I read and collected many different mangas. Similar to videogames, along the years I stopped to buy them, but I still enjoy to read them whenever I have time. A
          funny anecdote happened with my daughter. One day, she came to me, telling me that a lot of her friend was reading a quiet old manga called JoJo. She asked me if I knew it, I looked at her and said: "When we go back in Italy, I have the first five seasons of it in the Granma garage", her
          look was priceless and she could not be more excited!
        </p>

        <h2><span>B</span>oard <span>G</span>ames</h2>
        <p>
          It is the most recent hobby. I know that many people when I say board games, the first games that come in mind are Monopoly, Risk et Similar. In the last 20 years, the board games industry grew A LOT. Every year thousands of games are published. Furthermore, in the previous 3 years, I
          joined the most prominent online blog in Italy about board games, where I write an article every week.
        </p>

        <h2><span>O</span>ther <span>H</span>obbies</h2>
        <p>Movies and music always had space in my life, but I would say that one thing I love is travelling. My dream is to make a trip to Japan, but I am waiting for the right moment to have enough time and money to stay a minimum of 3 weeks and be able to go around the country.</p>
